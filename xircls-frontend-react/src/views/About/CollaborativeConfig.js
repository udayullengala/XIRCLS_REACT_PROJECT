        <p>XIRCLS started out by asking this simple question.</p>
        <p>Every day, thousands of companies invest time, money and resources individually to market to the same customer base.</p>
        <p>On advertising & marketing platforms, businesses bid and compete to grab the attention of potential customer, pushing ad prices higher and ROIs lower.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, consumers are bombarded with marketing messages that rarely make an 'impression' and are perceived as a nuisance.</p>
        <p>In a world where nobody wins - except Big Tech - enabling friction-less collaboration​​ between businesses could result in a more equitable marketing landscape that protects consumer interests as well.</p>
